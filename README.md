# 🧠 AI Memory Graph

AI-powered memory system that extracts structured knowledge from multi-user group chats. Inspired by [getzep.com](https://getzep.com), this project goes beyond 1:1 chatbot memory by supporting group dialogue, visualization, and structured memory export.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SpaCy, NetworkX, PyVis
* **NLP Model**: `en_core_web_trf` (Transformer-based for accurate triplet extraction)

---

## ✨ New Features

The project was extended with several new capabilities:

- ✅ Natural language question answering (`/qa`) — Ex: *“Kim MongoDB’yi seviyor?”*
- ✅ Triplet update functionality via `PUT /triplet/update/{id}`
- ✅ Triplet deletion via `DELETE /triplet/delete/{id}`
- ✅ UUID-based unique triplet identification
- ✅ Live-editable JSON memory file (`memory_export.json`) with real-time effect

These changes enable a dynamic and editable memory graph structure.

## 📌 Background & Requirement Context

This project was developed as part of an internship task inspired by the [getzep.com](https://getzep.com) architecture.

Zep extracts structured keypoints from conversation history between an AI chatbot and a single user. However, in many real-world cases, conversations occur in **multi-user group chats** (e.g., team discussions, meetings, etc.). The goal here was to replicate and **extend** Zep's capabilities to support:

* Group chats involving **multiple users**, not just 1:1 chatbot dialogue
* Extraction of **key information (triplets)** from each speaker's message
* **Graph-based memory** of “who said what and when”
* **Visual knowledge representation** inspired by Zep's open-source Graphiti framework ([github.com/getzep/graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti))

This implementation first began with single-user conversations (just like Zep), and was extended into **dummy group chat testing** to simulate real multi-user discussions.

The ultimate purpose is to **retrieve and summarize past group knowledge** through structured memory and make that memory easy to search, analyze, or visualize.

## 🎯 Project Objective & Solution Overview

### 🎯 Goal

To build a structured memory system for group conversations that allows us to:

* Identify **who said what and when**
* Extract meaningful insights from messages (subject–predicate–object)
* Store these insights in a format that is **machine-readable** and **queryable**
* Visualize relationships as a **knowledge graph**
* Support live memory editing (update, delete)
